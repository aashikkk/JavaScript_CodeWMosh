Value vs Reference Types

VALUE / PRIMITIVE
    Number
    String
    Boolean
    Symbol
    undefined
    null

Reference
    Object
    Function
    Array

in JS, we have Primitives and Objects. Almost Reference Types fulla objects
How Primitives and Objects behave differently.
SHOULD UNDERSTAND - for Prototypes 


Primitives are copied by their value.
Ref types or Objects are copied by their reference.


------Cloning Object-------------

Object.assign() copies the properties and methods from 1 or
more source objects into target object.
we can use that to clone an object or combine multiple objects
into single object.

Spread Operator used to spread an object, means getting all
it's properties and methods and putting them into another object.


--Garbage Collecter--------
In JS, we don't need to allocate or deallocate their memory
when declaring variables.
it will do automatically by own.

-----Math---------
Math Object used to do arithmetic things.
Math.random()
Math.min()
Math.max()

----------
Object is only have properties and methods. 
Not Primitives.
